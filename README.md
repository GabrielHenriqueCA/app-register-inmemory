# Memory Registration App
## About the project
**This project aims to practice a little of my .NET and C#**
**and along with that I made an app that creates, reads, updates, deletes, (CRUD), information that it saves in memory.**
**For a better understanding I used name, date, and series description.**
**This Project was supported by the Digital Innovation One Instruments (Organization of programming studies).**
